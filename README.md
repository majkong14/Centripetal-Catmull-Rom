# Catmull-Rom
A handy Centripetal Catmull-Rom spline generator.

Generates a Catmull-Rom spline by four specified control points.
You can use it if you already have the rest of the framework to do what 
you want. In this case, you can make a lib out of the code in Main branch 
or make some minor changes to the source code and use it as module for 
your convenience.
